    <h1>Accessible doors 4.0</h1>
    <h2>Designing away physical discrimination</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            Automatic accessible doors are not entirely automatic or inclusive because they require users to physically actuate a button to open doors, and doors only stay open based on a timer. 
        <p>
            I led user research and testing, where we learned that people with disabilities take 13x longer to get through an automated accessible door and are 10x more likely to be injured.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our team’s north star was to enable people with disabilities to become more independent – to open doors without needing to interact with any physical touchpoint.
            <p>
        </p>

            A core insight was to design the experience to optimize for that people with limited or no ability to move their limbs – who rely heavily on smartphones for everyday tasks – as the key to making doors accessible to everyone.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I directed user research and testing, design for UX/UI/visuals/interactions, was directly responsible for the mechanical and manufacturing engineering, and managed the product roadmap.

        <p>
            As a result of  Portal Entryways App enables its users to open any automatic accessible door hands-free as they approach.
