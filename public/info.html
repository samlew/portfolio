    <h1>Information</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a multi-disciplinary product designer and engineer who uses digital, physical, and cyber-physical medius to build experiences that help other humans. I’m most interested in working on social innovation problems and shaping user-centered experiences, teams, and companies in the 0→1 stage.
        </p>
        <p>
            I built a Y Combinator-backed startup,Portal Entryways︎︎︎, and currently head up product design at <a href="https://www.hireart.com">@HireArt︎︎︎</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of core work hours, my family and I are usually adventuring in nature, lounging around reading or playing video games, baking salted caramel double-dark chocolate chip cookies, or watching our dog, Onirigi, chase his tail.

    <h2>Operating principles</h2>
        <h3>Empathy for creativity</h3>
        <p>Be genuinely interested in other people and imagine how their world might be better through design.</p>

        <h3>Solve 90% with 10%</h3>
        <p>Clearly articulate and intensely focus on the core problem and be relentlessly resourceful in solving it.</p>

        <h3>Build the plane on the way down</h3>
        <p>Fearlessly dive into unknowns to build the experiences that people want that don't exist yet.</p>

        <h3>Intuition then metrics</h3>
        <p>Rely on intuition from observing user behavior to build 0 to 1 experiences, then measure to double down on what’s working well.</p>

        <h3>Get ship done</h3>
        <p>Foster trust and optimize the number of experiments validated with limited time and resources by shipping 'good enough'.</p>

        <h3>Integrity all ways</h3>
        <p>Create a safe environment, listen without judgment, and do what I say I’ll do when I say I’d do it.</p>
